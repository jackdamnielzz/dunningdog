## Positioning Statement
DunningDog is the failed-payment recovery upgrade for Stripe-based indie businesses that need measurable revenue recovery without enterprise pricing or complexity.

## Target Segment
1. Indie SaaS founders and creator businesses.
2. Stripe-first operations.
3. Approximate MRR band: 500 USD to 20,000 USD primary focus.

## Core Message
1. Connect Stripe in minutes.
2. Automatically recover failed payment revenue.
3. See exact dollars recovered and ROI every month.

## Competitive Framing
1. Primary alternative is "do nothing" or Stripe defaults.
2. Secondary alternatives are enterprise-priced dunning tools.
3. Differentiator: affordable + focused + easy setup.

## Messaging Guardrails
1. Lead with measurable outcomes.
2. Avoid claiming guaranteed recovery percentages.
3. Keep security and trust messaging concrete.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Launch copy and pricing pages use this positioning.
2. Support responses and onboarding copy stay message-consistent.

## Non-Goals
1. Enterprise sales narrative in MVP.
2. Multi-industry messaging variants in MVP.
